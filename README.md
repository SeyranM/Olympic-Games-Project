# Olympic-Games-Project
## About the Project
The Olympic-Games-Project is an educational endeavor designed to enhance understanding and skills in SQL through practical application. This project uses three datasets related to the Olympic Games — athletes.csv, countries.csv, and games.csv — to demonstrate and practice data querying and manipulation using SQL.

## Datasets
 - athletes.csv: Contains data about the athletes who have participated in the Olympic Games, including details like name, sport, and medals won.
 - countries.csv: This dataset includes information about the countries participating in the Olympics, such as country codes and names.
 - games.csv: Details about each Olympic Games, including the year, season (summer or winter), and the host city.

## Technical Requirements
This project requires an SQL environment to run. PostgreSQL is recommended for its comprehensive feature set and compliance with SQL standards.

## Installation
No specific installation of the project files is required. However, you will need to have PostgreSQL installed on your system. Ensure you have a working installation to interact with the datasets.

## Usage
To use this project:

 - Download or clone the repository containing the datasets to your local machine.
 - Import the CSV files into your PostgreSQL database. This can be done using the import functionality in PostgreSQL or via SQL commands.
 - Use SQL queries to interact with the data. The project includes a set of example queries that demonstrate basic SQL operations like SELECT, JOIN, and WHERE.

## Output
The primary output of this project is the ability to use SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the datasets. Example outputs include:

 - Lists of medal winners from a specific country.
 - Details of Olympic Games held in a particular year or city.
 - Statistical summaries of athletes’ performances across different sports.
These queries are designed to demonstrate essential SQL skills and can be modified or extended to explore the datasets further.

## Contributing
As an educational project, contributions that enhance the learning experience or add additional queries are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests with your improvements or suggestions.
